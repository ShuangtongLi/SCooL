We propose ``Structured Cooperative Learning (SCooL)'', in which a cooperation graph across devices is generated by a graphical model prior and it automatically coordinates mutual learning between devices. By choosing graphical models enforcing different structures, we can derive a rich class of classical and novel decentralized learning algorithms via standard variational inference. In particular, we show three examples that adopt Dirac distribution, stochastic block model (SBM), and attention as the prior generating the cooperation graph. These EM-type algorithms alternate between updating the cooperation graph and cooperative learning of local models. They can automatically capture the cross-task correlations among devices by only monitoring their model updating in order to optimize the cooperation graph.

We will release our code asap.
